# Silicon website with html, css and scss.
A project for my .net education on EC. The mission was to build a website based out of a designfile showcased through Figma.com. 

- The website needed to look as similar to the design-file as possible.
- It needed to be responsive for mobile, tablet and desktop-mode with working components and effects.
- It needed to have a class to be able to change from light- to darkmode with, no working toggler was a requirement.
- The css-code needed to be converted to sccs-code in the end.
